"""
This program contains a simple REST API implementation, with Flask, to receive
numeric data through a POST request on a specific end point to then store it in
a txt file. In addition, if a GET request is made for another specific end
point, it will then sum all the numeric values contained in that txt file to
then return the result in JSON format.
